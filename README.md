## Demo

End-to-end run through the **Specimen Lab** page: image upload → YOLO26n produce localization → scene-box filtering → DINOv3-S/16 freshness labels where evidence is strong → confidence + source badges. Unsupported uploads abstain instead of being forced into the nearest produce class.

## Headline results

| Metric                                  | Value      |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------: |
| **Classifier macro F1** (24-class)      | **0.9478** |
| Classifier top-1 accuracy               |   0.9490   |
| **KTH external type accuracy**          | **0.8995** |
| KTH external sample count               |      955   |
| Detector mAP@50                         |   0.8693   |
| Detector mAP@50–95                      |   0.8190   |
| Open Images negative false accept       |   0.0873   |
| Open Images positive retention          |   0.5951   |

Macro F1 is the headline because top-1 accuracy hides minority-class failure under the **41 : 1** class imbalance baked into the source dataset. The KTH row is type-only external evidence; KTH has no fresh/rotten labels, so it is not mixed into the canonical 24-class freshness metric. The Open Images rows measure open-world detector behavior on existing validated web-style data. Numbers come from `eval_report.json`, produced by [`notebooks/kaggle_05_evaluate_v2.ipynb`](notebooks/kaggle_05_evaluate_v2.ipynb).

## Architecture

<img alt="FreshGuard Inference Pipeline — YOLO26n produce localizer plus DINOv3-S/16 crop and full-image classifiers with crop ↔ full-image agreement gate" src="./assets/architecture-art-dark.png" width="100%">

The flow below is the same pipeline as the figure above, rendered as a flowchart so the routing logic is precise and reviewable.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    UP["📷 Uploaded image"]
    YOLO["YOLO26n · produce-only<br/>boxes · confidence"]
    CROP["DINOv3-S/16<br/>crop classifier · 24-class"]
    FULL["DINOv3-S/16<br/>full-image sanity check"]
    POST["Open-world filters<br/>drop scene boxes · reject weak full-frame boxes"]
    DET["✅ Detections<br/>(label · freshness · box · conf)"]
    PARTIAL["Apple / n_a<br/>type known · freshness uncertain"]
    UNK["🔶 unknown / n_a"]

    UP --> YOLO
    YOLO -->|"candidate boxes"| POST
    POST -->|"item-level boxes"| CROP
    POST -->|"no usable produce evidence"| UNK
    UP --> FULL
    CROP -->|"crop/full-image agree or full abstains"| DET
    CROP -->|"same type · freshness split"| PARTIAL
    CROP -->|"type disagreement or weak evidence"| UNK
    YOLO -->|"no boxes"| UNK
```

The 24-class label space is `{12 produce types} × {fresh, rotten}`. In v2 the detector has no type or freshness opinion; DINOv3 is the single authority for labels, applied to each crop, with the full image used as an out-of-distribution sanity check. Runtime filters now reject no-box uploads and weak near-full-frame detections instead of asking the closed-set classifier to guess.

## Quickstart

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Abdulrahman-Elsmmany/freshguard-vision.git
cd freshguard-vision
uv sync
uv run python scripts/download_artifacts.py
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

Requires Python 3.12, [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and local PyTorch model weights downloaded from a GitHub Release. Inference is local PyTorch only — no cloud APIs, no ONNX, no remote services.

### Model Downloads

The checkpoints are release assets, not git files. The app expects:

| File | Purpose | Size |
|---|---|---:|
| `yolo26n_produce_v2_1.pt` | one-class produce detector with Open Images negative hardening | ~5 MB |
| `dinov3_vits16_food_freshness_v2.pt` | DINOv3-S/16 24-class classifier | ~83 MB |

The download script fetches both into `artifacts/`:

```powershell
uv run python scripts/download_artifacts.py
```

Manual download is also fine: open the latest GitHub Release, download both
`.pt` files, and place them in `artifacts/`. The app will stay in a clear
"models not ready" state until both files are present.

## Per-class performance

Best-performing classes (classifier macro F1):

| Class                | F1    | Support |
| -------------------- | ----: | ------: |
| `bitter_gourd_fresh` | 1.000 |      48 |
| `bitter_gourd_rotten`| 1.000 |      54 |
| `strawberry_fresh`   | 1.000 |     147 |
| `banana_rotten`      | 0.995 |     555 |
| `strawberry_rotten`  | 0.989 |      90 |

Weakest:

| Class                | F1    | Support |
| -------------------- | ----: | ------: |
| `carrot_rotten`      | 0.855 |     381 |
| `orange_rotten`      | 0.865 |     452 |
| `bellpepper_fresh`   | 0.866 |     353 |
| `bellpepper_rotten`  | 0.886 |     356 |
| `tomato_rotten`      | 0.897 |     477 |

The weakest v2 classes are still above 0.85 F1, a large lift over the v1 `okra_*` floor. Most remaining confusion sits near fine-grained visual boundaries and the **fresh ↔ rotten** boundary within a single produce type. Full breakdown: [`eval_report.md`](./eval_report.md).

## Training pipeline

Every step runs on Kaggle. The six v2 notebooks under `notebooks/` chain their outputs through Kaggle Datasets — each notebook publishes a dataset that the next one attaches as input.

| # | Notebook | Kaggle inputs | Accelerator | Save output as |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `kaggle_00_fetch_official_sources_v2.ipynb` | none; Internet on | none | `freshguard-official-sources-v2-1` |
| 1 | `kaggle_01_dataset_audit_v2.ipynb` | `ulnnproject/food-freshness-dataset`, `freshguard-official-sources-v2` | none | `freshguard-v2-splits` |
| 2 | `kaggle_02_prepare_detector_data_v2.ipynb` | `ulnnproject/food-freshness-dataset`, `freshguard-v2-splits`, `freshguard-official-sources-v2-1` | none | `freshguard-v2-1-detector-data` |
| 3 | `kaggle_03_train_detector_v2.ipynb` | `freshguard-v2-1-detector-data` | T4 x2 | `freshguard-v2-1-detector-artifacts` |
| 4 | `kaggle_04_train_classifier_dinov3_v2.ipynb` | `freshguard-v2-splits`, `ulnnproject/food-freshness-dataset`, `freshguard-official-sources-v2` | T4 x2 | `freshguard-v2-classifier-artifacts` |
| 5 | `kaggle_05_evaluate_v2.ipynb` | splits, detector data, detector artifact, classifier artifact, official sources, Food Freshness, optional five-apple dataset | P100 or T4 | `freshguard-v2-1-eval` |

The v1 notebooks remain in the directory as the shipped v0.2.0 evidence trail.

## What's In The Repo, What's In The Release

The `.pt` checkpoints are large and don't belong in git. v1 outputs are archived locally under `deprecated/` and remain out of version control. The v2 runtime expects:

- `yolo26n_produce_v2_1.pt` — produce-only detector with Open Images negative hardening
- `dinov3_vits16_food_freshness_v2.pt` — DINOv3-S/16 classifier

`scripts/download_artifacts.py` resolves the latest release via the GitHub API and drops both files into `artifacts/` automatically.

---

## Honest limitations

- **The weakest v2 classifier classes are still imperfect**: `carrot_rotten` (F1 0.855), `orange_rotten` (0.865), and `bellpepper_fresh` (0.866).
- **KTH is type-only external evidence.** It has official grocery image splits but no fresh/rotten labels, so it cannot validate the 24-class freshness contract by itself.
- **Detector supervision is mixed**: Food Freshness and KTH contribute full-image bootstrap boxes, while Open Images contributes official object boxes plus v2.1 negative/background examples with empty YOLO labels. Runtime scene-box suppression reduces the visible impact, but more instance-level boxes remain the next detector-quality lever.
- **Open Images positive retention is the next detector target**: v2.1 measures a low negative false-accept rate (0.0873), but retains 0.5951 of Open Images positive images at the current runtime threshold.
- **Out-of-distribution images** (cluttered scenes, novel varieties, non-produce subjects) trigger the detector/open-world gates, classifier abstain stack, crop/full-image disagreement guard, or `unknown` — the system would rather refuse than confidently hallucinate.
- **Freshness can be uncertain even when type is clear.** Same-produce fresh/rotten ties are surfaced as `<produce> / n_a` instead of pretending the binary freshness decision is settled.
- **Binary freshness only.** No shelf-life forecast, no "medium" / partial-ripeness label.
